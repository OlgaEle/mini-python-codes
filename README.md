# üêç Mini Python Codes

Welcome to **Mini Python Codes**! üéâ

A playful collection of tiny, useful, and beginner-friendly Python scripts. Each file is a little learning adventure‚Äîgrab, run, tweak, and enjoy!

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside? (So far!)

Here‚Äôs a quick tour of the scripts you‚Äôll find in this repo:

- [**basic_counter.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/basic_counter.py)  
  A simple loop that counts from 0 to 4, printing each number. Great for learning `while` loops!

- [**check_even_odd.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/check_even_odd.py)  
  Shows off several ways to check if a number (or a list of numbers) is even or odd: using modulus, bitwise, functions, lambdas, list comprehensions, map, filter, and even timing the methods! Interactive and educational.

- [**leap_year.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/leap_year.py)  
  Function to check if a given year is a leap year (with input validation). Enter a year and see if it qualifies!

- [**list_comprehensions.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/list_comprehensions.py)  
  Explores nested list comprehensions: generates coordinate lists that don‚Äôt sum to a given value. A nice intro to comprehensions and filtering.

- [**moving_dot.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/moving_dot.py)  
  Animates a dot moving along a line in a list, showing how to update positions and print results. It‚Äôs a cute way to visualize movement and list manipulation.

- [**number_guess.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/number_guess.py)  
  A mini game! The program picks a random number from 1 to 10; you try to guess it. Gives feedback and reveals the answer.

- [**palindrome_number.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/palindrome_number.py)  
  Class-based solution to check if a number is a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward). Raises an error if the number is out of bounds.

- [**random_move_1d.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/random_move_1d.py)  
  Simulates a dot moving left or right at random along a line. Good for understanding randomness and list updates.

- [**runner_up_score.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/runner_up_score.py)  
  Finds the "runner-up" (second highest) score from user input, with error handling for edge cases.

- [**two_sum.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/two_sum.py)  
  Classic algorithm: finds indices of two numbers in a list that add up to a target value. Returns all such pairs (with input validation).

- [**sum_list.py**](https://github.com/OlgaEle/mini-python-codes/blob/main/sum_list.py)  
  Takes a list of numbers and returns their sum. Simple and perfect for practicing list operations and basic functions.

## ‚öí How to Use

1. Browse the scripts.
2. Copy any `.py` file you like.
3. Run it in your Python environment (some scripts expect user input in the terminal!).
4. Modify, experiment, and learn!

Made with ‚ù§Ô∏è, üêç, and a sprinkle of curiosity.
